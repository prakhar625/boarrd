# Installation


## Dependencies

The dependencies are:
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) [>=v0.10.x]
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) [>=1.8.7]
* [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) [>=3.5.x]
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) [>=3.3.x]


```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to gain elevated permissions using `sudo` (i.e `sudo npm install --global gulp`). Next, install the local dependencies Web Starter Kit requires:

```sh
$ sudo npm install
```

That's it! You should now have everything needed.
